            <h1>The History of The Internet</h1>
            <p>The Internet got its start in the United States more than 50 years ago as a government weapon in the cold
                war.
                The United States department of defense had recently created the Advanced Research Projects Agency
                (ARPA), to keep its tech ahead of the soviets.</p>
            <p>A computer enthusiast named Jospeh Licklider helped convince ARPA to fund research into a computer
                network connecting scientists and engineers thought the country.</p>
            <p>A few colleges agreed to be involved and ARPA started building the network in 1969, they called it the
                ARPANET.
                It started fairly small, as a sort of messaging service between computer at University of California,
                Stanford University, and The University of Utah</p>
            <p>ARPANET kept growing through the 1970s and had a network of over 100 computers by 1978. Other networks
                were popping up around the world. Transmission Control was invented in order for all networks to
                communicate to each other, forming what became known as The Internet!</p>
            <p>By the end of 1987, over 20,000 computers were already connected. However, The Internet was still
                restricted to universities and corporations which use it for specific types of collaboration and
                research. </p>
            <p>In the early 1990s, connecting to The Internet was slow. Your computer had to place a phone call to the
                network through a modem, which translated between the digital signals used in computers and analog
                signals used in land line phones.</p>
            <p>The Web was made public in 1993. It was the final major piece of today's Internet was in place. With the
                Web and Internet finally paired up and publicly accessible, the number of computers using the internet
                explored in the 90s and billions of dollars were poured into start up companies on the internet through
                the 1990s.</p>
